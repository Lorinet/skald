# Skald

### A complete event sourcing, durable execution and distributed high-level Saga orchestration framework for Rust & more

## Why Skald?

Building backends for a wide range of software solutions, spanning from embedded systems to multi node, massive scale online services is no easy task. The microservices architecture aims to separate and streamline the responsibilities of the backend into loosely coupled, independently deployable components, but modeling a flow involving them is hard to do in a deterministic, fail-safe way.

Skald offers a unified backbone for microservices that facilitates the implementation of various event-driven asynchronous patterns such as event sourcing, remote procedure calls, durable execution and Sagas.

As for the name, skalds are really good at writing sagas about heroes - let this one write the success story of your backend!
